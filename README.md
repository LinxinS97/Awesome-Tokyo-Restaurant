## Introduction

This repository records restaurants around Waseda University, Takadanobaba, Ueno, etc, created by a group of Chinese international students at Waseda University.

A group of reviewers verified all these restaurants and gave feedback to the repo.
We separate the restaurants by different areas.
Check the link below to access those restaurants.

## How to contribute?

Our repo does not support directly committing to `main.` 

You need to first **checkout to a branch with the same name as the area** and modify the page/page-cn.md in the corresponding area. After that, you can submit a pull request to merge your change to the `main`.

**DO NOT modify the area's page when the branch's name is different.**

**DO NOT modify other reviewers' comments; you can submit your new comment on the same restaurant.**

As a reference, your contribution should (at least) include the following information:

```md
## The restaurant's name.
- by [Reviewer's nickname]: your nickname that can help people know who you are (a github username is recommended).
- Rates: your rate (range from 1 to 5, .5 is excluded) for the restaurant.
- Dates: Your comment date should be formatted as yyyy/mm/dd.
- Comment: Your comment on the restaurant.
- Address or Google Maps link: a link to the google maps so that people can understand where the restaurant is. If there is no link for the restaurant, please fill in the specific address.
- (Optional) Link to other apps, e.g., tabelog
```
